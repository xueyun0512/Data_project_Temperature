# Python - Temperature analysis 2023

## Introduction
In this second project, I worked with Python in order to analyse the temperature evolution of 2023 for all the districts in France.  <br> 
The Jupyter Notebook I wrote could be found in the same folder.

## Skills demonstrated
- Python - **panda**  and **matplotlib** libraries
- Power BI - Visualization
- Math - statistics 

## Table of content 
1) Input data
2) Evolution of the minimum, maximum and average temperatures of the district Pays de la Loire 
3) Comparison of the monthly temperature changing regarding the district
4) How is the temperature increasing?
5) Conclusion

## 1) Input data 
The data comes from [here](https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/temperature-quotidienne-regionale/information/?disjunctive.region) and show the daily temperature (in Â°C) of 2023 in different districts in France. There are 3 types categories of temperature: the maximum _(Tmax)_, the minimum _(Tmin)_, and the average _(Tavg)_. <br>. I've created an additional column _Temperature difference_ in order to visualize how the temperature increases. 

## 2) Evolution of the minimum, maximum and average temperatures of the district Pays de la Loire
Given the dataset, it may be interesting to plot and look at the difference between the minimum, the maximum and the average temperature. I was especially curious about the district of Pays de la Loire so I only plotted from it. I got the figure below:
